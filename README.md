# Medicine Leaflets

The objective of this project is to collect, organize and mine information from medicine leaflets distributed by health regulatory agencies around the world . This is an open science project. This means everybody is welcome (and encouraged) to contribute however they can, using whichever skills they have. Your contributions to the project will be recorded as comments in the issue tracker and pull requests to our repo. We will use those to automatically build a list of participants to give credit to everyone that helped.

## How to participate?

You can choose to help with whatever you're comfortable with:
* if you do not possess specialized scientific or engineering skills, you can help us find more material to add, or with many other tasks we may have (ask us!)
* if you are a health sciences professional, send questions you'd like us to answer, help us to curate the data and analyze the results
* if you are a data scientist, help us acquire + clean + mine the data
* if you are a software engineer or developer, help us to create or improve the code to support all of the above tasks
* if you are a designer, help us to do all of this with more efficacy and beauty!
